            <h2>ISO 20022 | La evolución de las transacciones
                <hr>
                <br> <br>
                <p>
                    While many people in the financial services industry have
                    heard about ISO 20022, few truly understand what it is
                    about and what is so great about it. We at SWIFT are
                    convinced that ISO 20022 can bring profound benefits to the
                    financial services industry, as it improves end-to-end processing
                    across domains and geographies that currently use vastly different standards and information
                    formats. This book removes the
                    mystery from ISO 20022, helps you understand why it matters,
                    and lets you see how you can benefit from it.
                    And we’re not the only ones. Payments systems covering all major
                    currencies have either adopted ISO 20022 or are in the process of
                    adopting it, and the financial community has now decided that it
                    is time for all payments to move from SWIFT MT to ISO 20022.
                    ISO 20022 represents a big opportunity to improve the quality of
                    payments data end to end, which enables improved efficiency,
                    compliance and customer experience.
                </p>
                <br> <br> <br>
                <p>
                    In this context, financial standards are definitions of everything
                    from broad concepts to microscopic pieces of business data, and
                    all points between. These definitions are captured in a highly structured model, which can then
                    export those definitions to
                    developers and users of applications, screens, messages, API calls
                    and any other data representation that needs to speak the language of financial transactions with
                    clarity and precision.
                    To conduct their business, financial institutions exchange massive amounts of information with their
                    customers and among
                    themselves. Such exchanges only work if the sender and receiver
                    of a message have a common understanding of how to interpret
                    this information. This is especially true if either party wishes to
                    rely entirely on computers to process information
                </p>
                <br> <br> <br>
                <p>
                    The syntax is the format in which the information in a message is
                    structured. Unless the reader understands a specific syntax, it will
                    not be possible to understand the message content. There is a lot
                    of confusion about the difference between a standard and a syntax. The standard describes the
                    agreement on what information is
                    expressed, while the syntax is the format, or the ‘language’ used
                    to express that information. It is difficult for two people to have a
                    conversation unless they both use and understand the same language. The same is true for syntax.
                    Globalisation and the everincreasing need for end-to-end processing increases the problem.
                    In ISO 20022, the most widely used syntax is eXtensible Mark-up
                    Language (XML). The use of short tag names (like <PstlAdr> to
                        represent a postal address) is also part of the syntax.
                        XML is one of the most popular syntaxes to encode documents
                        (or messages) electronically on the Internet. XML allows communities to define their own
                        identifiers (or tags) and format (or
                        data type) for each component of a message. With XML, data is
                        marked up by using opening and closing tags that indicate the
                        meaning and structure of the information that is communicated.
                        For example, <Dt>2019-09-29</Dt> is an XML representation of
                        29 September 2019. The combination of opening and closing tags
                        with the data is called an element.

                <p>
                    One of the key characteristics of the ISO 20022 methodology
                    is that there is a distinct separation between the business and
                    the way it is represented in a message, that is, the syntax. The
                    ISO 20022 methodology starts with the creation of the business
                    model. Put simply, this is the definition of the activity or business process, the business roles
                    and actors involved in that activity and the business information needed in order for the activity
                    to take place.
                    The business information is organised into business components containing business elements. For
                    example, when looking
                    at the processes involved in a credit transfer, key notions such
                    as debtor (the party that pays), creditor (the money receiver),
                    debtor agent (the bank of the debtor), creditor agent (the bank
                    of the creditor) and payment were identified. Each of these
                    components has further details. Figure 1-1 shows a simplified
                    business information model, represented in Unified Modeling
                    Language (UML).
                    Central is the payment itself, which is associated with the debtor
                    agent and creditor agent, which are both financial institutions.
                    The payment is also associated with a debtor and creditor, which
                    are both parties (in other words, persons or organisations, financial or other), which in turn have
                    elements such as a name and
                    address. Additionally, these parties may be owners of an account.
                    Behind these elements lie further details. A payment, for example, contains elements such as
                    currency and amount, a requested
                    execution date and settlement date, and remittance information.

                <p>
                    A logical message is a description of all the information that
                    is needed to perform a specific business activity, independent
                    of syntax. It is composed of message components organised in
                    a hierarchical structure. A message component contains one or
                    more message elements and is derived from a business component by using one, some or all of its
                    elements. The logical message structure for the excerpt of the Customer Credit Transfer

                <p>
                    What about MT 103s and ISO 20022 messages?
                    For European retail payments the first migration to ISO 20022 is
                    a fact. Financial institutions in Europe have adopted ISO 20022
                    messages, complemented with implementation guidelines, to
                    meet the specific Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) community
                    requirements. ISO 20022 is now the common standard for SEPA
                    compliant payments and has replaced a multitude of domestic
                    standards.
                    As adoption progresses further, some players may find it easier to
                    use ISO 20022 for all of their interbank payments. Furthermore,
                    banks that have gone through an implementation in the interbank
                    area are also starting to look at implementation in the payments
                    initiation and reporting space. For the next few years, these banks
                    will be able to use message translation products and services to
                    map their ISO 20022 messages to MT 103s in order to communicate with their correspondent banks that
                    are not (yet) using ISO
                    20022. By the end of 2025, adoption of ISO 20022 throughout the
                    correspondent banking domain will be complete.

                <p>
                    To continue with our language analogy, does everyone use translators to communicate with foreigners?
                    Of course not; most people have some knowledge of other languages and sometimes one
                    of the participants in the conversation will revert to an ‘internal’
                    translation and switch to the language of the conversation partner. Often, both participants settle
                    on a lingua franca (English,
                    Swahili, Hindi), whereby both parties translate internally to and
                    from this third language. Life is also made easier by the fact that
                    most service providers (telecommunications, banks, governments) allow customers to work with them in
                    the language of
                    their choice.
                    Financial institutions are no different. Many use their own internal formats to store information
                    and exchange it between applications. They then map this information to whatever format is
                    needed for the outside world. Even when these outside formats
                    change, they often continue to use the old version internally and
                    map it to the new format before sending it out. It’s true that the
                    securities industry migrated from ISO 7775 to ISO 15022 in 2004,
                    but many securities players still use ISO 7775 internally and with
                    some of their customers. Similarly, in 2003, SWIFT replaced its
                    workhorse MT 100 Customer Transfer with a new format, the
                    MT 103 Single Customer Credit Transfer, but several institutions
                    still use the MT 100 internally. Typically these institutions find it
                    cheaper to map/transform the information to and from the new
                    format than to change their legacy applications. For centuries,
                    people dreamt of a common language (for example, Esperanto) to
                    breach the communication gap. However, this dream never materialised. Standardisers shared a similar
                    dream over 10 years ago
                    and are now facing the same issue: multiple standards will not go
                    away any time soon. As a consequence, coexistence is not a shortterm situation and the challenge
                    becomes one of interoperability
                    between different standards.

                <p>
                    In June 2009, SWIFT and DTCC embarked on an initiative with
                    XBRL US to build a corporate actions taxonomy that is fully aligned
                    with the ISO 20022 dictionary for corporate actions elements. In
                    this way, corporate issuers of securities can tag their corporate
                    actions documents and create XML data that can be easily used in
                    ISO 20022 corporate action messages for financial intermediaries
                    downstream in the corporate actions life-cycle process.
                    Issuers (or their agents) can ‘tag’ documents using an XBRL tagging tool and the resulting XBRL
                    instance document can then be
                    automatically transformed into an ISO 20022 corporate actions
                    message for consumption by financial and other intermediaries
                    involved downstream.
                    This was the first collaboration of its kind across standardisation domains - XBRL in the
                    accounting and business reporting
                    domain, and ISO 20022 (SWIFT and DTCC) in the transaction processing domain
                </p>
                <br> <br> <br>
                <p>
                    Focused players in areas such as European retail payments or the
                    funds industry need ISO 20022 to operate. If this is you, you have
                    to implement ISO 20022 capabilities, so you have to install communications and interface software
                    that is ISO 20022 aware. Players with legacy systems that use existing standards (domestic,
                    proprietary or other) may decide not to migrate these systems to
                    ISO 20022, but instead rely on mapping at the middleware level.
                    Players facing new investments, however, may decide to enable
                    their applications for ISO 20022 from the start. Examples could be
                    transfer agents in Asia that are making investments to replace the
                    current fax and phone communications, and new market infrastructures in securities.

                <p>
                    So you have to deal with the Tower of Babel on a daily basis: many
                    different formats across geographies and businesses and large
                    legacy systems that are very expensive to change. In all likelihood
                    your institution already uses enterprise scale middleware –
                    sometimes known as Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)
                    software – to connect applications and communications interfaces, mapping and transforming
                    information as needed. In
                    a highly simplified form, your overall architecture could look
                    similar

                <br> <br> <br>
                <p>
                    How much will it cost? A difficult question because no two institutions are alike. However, the fact
                    that ISO 20022 mostly uses
                    XML syntax does help, mainly because the popularity of XML has
                    driven commoditisation in the XML tools market, and first-class
                    integration tools are available from many vendors and opensource projects; but also because XML
                    skills are increasingly easy
                    to find. The balance of implementation cost has, therefore, tilted
                    away from technology concerns towards business analysis. From
                    a business analysis point of view, the consistency across data
                    element definitions enforced by the dictionary (and the separation of the semantic layer)
                    significantly simplifies the exercise,
                    especially as people build up ISO 20022-specific skills. With the
                    critical mass that ISO 20022 has in the industry, the likelihood of
                    reusing content you have seen before is indeed very high.

                    ISO 20022 messages are designed to support current and future
                    business needs around the world. To this end, specifications
                    include international characters in narrative fields, long identifiers and references, large
                    monetary amounts and precise
                    interest and exchange rates. If you are a technical architect or
                    a designer of back-office systems, you should take into account
                    both the semantics of ISO 20022, which provide an internationally agreed common vocabulary for
                    financial industry concepts,
                    and the physical forms in which these concepts are represented.
                    In this way, you can guarantee that systems will be aligned with
                    ISO 20022 for messaging purposes, but also with the industry’s
                    collective wisdom regarding the best ways to represent financial

                    Any organisation can develop and improve the ISO 20022
                    catalogue. You don’t need to be affiliated with ISO, but you
                    are obliged to comply with the rules set out in the ISO
                    20022 standard. The standard describes the method to develop
                    the standards as well as the process to get them approved and
                    published as part of the official portfolio of ISO 20022 publications. Twenty-five organisations
                    have already embarked on
                    developing ISO 20022 definitions.
                    A series of bodies have been created to monitor the use of the
                    standard and to help organisations develop successful and compliant messages.

                <p>
                    Approval of your business justification gives you the green light
                    to start developing the messages. Before you start, you will need
                    to contact the ISO 20022 Registration Authority (RA).
                    The RA is the guardian of the ISO 20022 repository, which includes
                    all existing ISO 20022 messages and the dictionary of ISO 20022
                    components. SWIFT acts as the RA under a contractual agreement
                    with ISO.
                    The RA will provide the input and guidelines required to develop
                    the syntax independent logical message models. For this, you will
                    reuse existing ISO 20022 message components or ask the RA to
                    create new components, if necessary.
                    You will need a modelling tool to design the message models.
                    SWIFT can provide you with a lite version of the Standards Editors
                    tool, which was developed by SWIFT to use for its own development of ISO 20022 message models and,
                    in its role of ISO 20022
                    RA, to verify the compliance of ISO 20022 message models submitted by others.

                    SWIFT’s commitment to ISO 20022 is broad and deep. In 2000,
                    SWIFT drafted the original ISO 20022 specification as part of the
                    ISO working group that developed the standard.
                    In June 2004, SWIFT was appointed Registration Authority (RA)
                    for the standard – a role that SWIFT continues to fulfil. The RA
                    is responsible for maintaining and publishing the central repository of ISO 20022 content and
                    ensuring its integrity. The first
                    formal edition of the standard was approved and published by ISO
                    in December of the same year. In its role of RA, SWIFT developed
                    and continues to support and update ISO 20022 web resources,
                    including www.iso20022.org and the web query tool shown in

                    The RMG – the body responsible for the overall supervision of
                    the registration process – was formed in January 2005. SWIFT
                    sends delegations representing both the RA and SWIFT to RMG
                    meetings.
                    In June 2005, the first two ISO 20022 Standards Evaluation
                    Groups (SEG) were formed for the business domains of Payments
                    and Securities. In 2006, two more SEGs were formed for Trade
                    and Foreign Exchange business, followed in 2008 by a new SEG
                    for Cards. In 2016, a specific Derivatives SEG was created to work
                    within the Securities SEG. The role of the SEGs is to review submitted message definitions in terms
                    of their business content.
                    SWIFT is represented on all six SEGs.
                    In addition to the expertise SWIFT contributes to ensure the validity of the business content of
                    the standard, SWIFT is also active on
                    the technical front. SWIFT participated actively to the definition
                    of the second edition of ISO 20022, which was published by ISO
                    in May 2013.

                    Translation and mapping rules
                    For some key areas such as high-value payments, SWIFT has
                    developed mapping rules between SWIFT’s existing and widelyused MT messages and ISO 20022 messages.
                    These were developed with key members of the SWIFT community and are made
                    available to members and partners on MyStandards.

                    As usage of ISO 20022 messaging has increased over the last few
                    years, it has become increasingly important to develop a consistent approach for implementation of
                    ISO 20022 solutions. Consistency is required both in the way that message standards are used
                    and how releases are managed.
